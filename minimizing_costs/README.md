# Minimizing the Costs in Energy Consumption of a Data Center

The builded solution use's an AI to minimize energy consumption of a single server, 
and thanks to the object oriented structure implementation, 
the AI model will be applicable to any server of a same data center, 
thus minimizing the costs of the whole data center. The algorithm implemented it's Deep Q-Learn
